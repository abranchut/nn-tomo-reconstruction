An implementation of the NN-FBP algorithm from [1]_, and the MSD network from [2]_, [3]_ using the pytorch library, as well as some other utility functions, in the context of applying the algorithm to STEM measurements on COFs and MOFs. Right now, it can only run on a NVIDIA GPU with at least 24 GB of memory.

To install, run ``pip install .`` in the root folder.

**Documentation**

The documentation is currently available in ``CentralData/Temp/Alix/documentation nntomo`` on the IMW server. Alternatively, the documentation can be generated by running ``make html`` in the ``docs`` folder (sphinx_ and pydata-sphinx-theme_ must be installed).

.. _sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html
.. _pydata-sphinx-theme: https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html

**Code structure**

The code is currently structured into 7 files:

- ``volume.py`` contains the class Volume, to represent 3d objects (wrapper of a 3d numpy array),
- ``projection_stack.py`` contains the class ProjectionStack, to represent stacks of projections from tomography in various formats; reconstruction methods are here,
- ``network.py`` contains the training functions for the two neural networks,
- ``nnfbp.py`` contains the pytorch Dataset and Network classes for the NN-FBP algorithm,
- ``msdnet.py`` contains the pytorch Dataset and Network classes for the MSDNET algorithm,
- ``custom_interp.py`` contains custom interpolation functions running on GPU for fast dataset computation and fast reconstruction,
- ``utilities.py`` contains utility functions.
